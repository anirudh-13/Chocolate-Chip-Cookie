1 1/2 cups pastry flour
1 1/2 cups bread flour (note you can sub all-purpose flour for both of these if needed)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temp
1 1/4 cups packed light brown sugar
3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
2 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
8 ounces dark chocolate, coarsely chopped
4 ounces caramel flavored chocolate (or whatever chocolate you love!), coarsely chopped
4 ounces white chocolate (or whatever chocolate you love!), coarsely chopped
Large crystal sea salt, for sprinkling


Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, stir both flours with the baking powder and baking soda.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle or using a handheld mixer, cream the butter at medium-high speed until smooth, about 30 seconds.
Add both sugars and the kosher salt and beat at medium-low speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. At low speed, beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition. Beat in the vanilla.
Beat in the dry ingredients in 3 parts, mixing well each time and scraping down the side of the bowl occasionally. At low speed, stir in the chocolate until just combined.
Using a 1 ½-ounce ice cream scoop (about 3 tablespoons), scoop slightly rounded mounds (2-inch mounds) of the dough onto the prepared parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving a tiny bit of space between the cookies.
Transfer the baking sheet with cookie dough to the freezer and freeze for at least 24 hours. (Once frozen, the cookie dough balls can be removed from the baking sheet and transferred to plastic freezer bags)
Preheat the oven to 325°F. Transfer the cookies to 3 parchment paper-lined baking sheets and space them about 2 inches apart; you should have 2 rows of 4 cookies per sheet. Sprinkle the tops with sea salt and bake for 22 minutes or until lightly browned; rotate the baking sheets halfway through baking. Transfer the cookies to a rack to cool. The cookies can be kept in an airtight container at room temp for 3 days.
